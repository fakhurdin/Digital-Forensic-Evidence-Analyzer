The /DFEA/DFEA/assets/fonts directory is typically used to store font files that can be used in the web application. Since you have not specified any particular fonts to include, I will create a placeholder file structure for the fonts directory.

This directory will be intentionally left blank for now, as it is common to add font files later as needed.
